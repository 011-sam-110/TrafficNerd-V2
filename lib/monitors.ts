// worldmonitor.app ships "monitor variants" (World / Tech / Finance / …). This is
// the calm-light analogue: a small set of CURATED combos that each flip BOTH the
// core world layers (lib/layers — cameras/planes/satellites/webcams) AND the
// opt-in global signal layers (lib/signals/store — earthquakes, cables, aurora …)
// to a sensible state in one tap, with a calm label.
//
// The combo definitions live here as plain data; the (lat-thin) pure functions
// derive the full on/off maps and find which monitor (if any) the live state
// matches. applyMonitor() is the only impure piece: it drives the EXISTING store
// APIs (layersStore.set / signalsStore.set) — it never re-implements toggle logic.
