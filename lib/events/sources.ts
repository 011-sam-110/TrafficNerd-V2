// lib/events/sources.ts
// The curated set of signal sources that emit discrete, time/place-stamped EVENTS
// for the feed. Seeded with the proven ids the Top Events panel already fetches
// successfully (components/shell/TopEventsPanel.tsx). Add more (floods, severe-
// storms, volcanoes, conflict) as each one's normalized magnitude scale is
// confirmed — see the registry in lib/signals/registry.ts.
//
// magnitudeUnit is set ONLY where props.magnitude genuinely IS that unit, so the
// row can show a native value without the Round-1 "MW" mislabel. Leave it unset
// and the row leans on the source's own title for the human magnitude.
