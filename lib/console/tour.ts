// The guided product tour — a spotlight walkthrough of the console for first-time
// visitors, replayable on demand. This file is the PURE data + logic half: the
// ordered step list (each pointing at a stable CSS target) plus the first-visit
// gating and index maths. The overlay that draws the spotlight + coach-mark lives
// in components/shell/TourOverlay.tsx; the persisted "seen" flag + active state
// live in lib/shell/tour.ts. Keeping the steps + gating here makes them unit-testable
// with no DOM (mirrors the other pure-logic-with-a-fixture-test modules).
